    "response": "The problem discussed revolves around the consequences of the pandemic, which has led to the infection of about 2 million Americans and over 110,000 deaths. It has also highlighted and exacerbated long-standing issues in the United States such as societal division, economic inequality, racial discrimination, and inadequate protections for vulnerable populations. Additionally, there is a theme of denial from individuals about the existence of these problems, which hampers the possibility of acknowledging and addressing them effectively. The need for open dialogue and acknowledgment of these issues is emphasized as a way to foster actual solutions.",
