    "response": "The types of racism being reported include:\n\n1. **Interpersonal/Personally-mediated Racism**: This involves prejudice and discrimination expressed in public settings among individuals. It can manifest as slurs, biases, or hateful words or actions directed towards individuals based on their race.\n\n2. **Institutional Racism**: This occurs through policies and practices within institutions that, either intentionally or unintentionally, create inequalities for racial groups. \n\n3. **Internalized Racism**: This refers to individuals from marginalized groups accepting negative societal beliefs and stereotypes about themselves. It often leads to a distortion of self-perception among affected individuals.\n\n4. **Cultural Racism**: A set of societal beliefs and customs that maintain a system valuing one race over others, often perpetuating stereotypes and excluding other cultures.\n\n5. **Structural Racism**: This term describes a system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, and other norms perpetuate racial inequity. It is often viewed as the most profound and pervasive form of racism, affecting various aspects of society.\n\nReports have indicated various forms of racism manifesting due to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased incidents involving verbal attacks, physical intimidation, and discriminatory actions in public settings. These incidents are often underreported, particularly among older adults and members of immigrant communities due to fears surrounding immigration status and policing.",
