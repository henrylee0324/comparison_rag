Addressing the Question\n- **Response 1** effectively catalogs a wide array of emotions, including grief, fear, and frustration, while also identifying specific community voices (notably from Asian-Americans) and their reactions to anti-Asian violence. It articulates a perceived need for persistent awareness and activism.\n- **Response 2** similarly identifies feelings such as fear and anger but emphasizes themes like vulnerability, anger towards scapegoating, and historical context.
