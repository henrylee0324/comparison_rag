    "query": "For other individuals (e.g., celebrities, professionals, politicians, and general public): What kinds of feelings or reactions towards the anti-Asian incidents were described in the mainstream and non-mainstream media for them?",
    "response": "Mainstream and non-mainstream media have documented a range of feelings and reactions from various individuals, including celebrities, professionals, politicians, and the general public regarding anti-Asian incidents. Here are some key sentiments reported:\n\n1. **Fear and Vulnerability**: Many individuals expressed feelings of fear and vulnerability, particularly members of the Asian American community. This has been highlighted in narratives that discuss how incidents of violence and harassment impact anxiety levels and comfort in public spaces. For instance, an Asian Pacific American representative noted the discomfort individuals feel when going out due to rising violence.\n\n2. **Anger and Frustration**: Public reactions have also included anger, particularly directed at the scapegoating and racist narratives perpetuated by some political figures. Many have criticized the media for its inadequate coverage of anti-Asian hate crimes, leading to feelings of frustration that these incidents are not adequately acknowledged or addressed.\n\n3. **Solidarity and Advocacy**: There has been a significant call for solidarity among various communities. Some social media campaigns and movements have aimed to push back against harmful narratives and to highlight the experiences of Asian Americans. Advocacy efforts to promote awareness and bring attention to these issues were noted in various discussions, emphasizing the importance of collective action.\n\n4. **Disappointment in Media Representation**: Individuals have reacted with disappointment regarding how the media has historically represented Asian Americans. Many pointed out that media narratives often involve stereotypes and do not adequately reflect the diversity of experiences within the community, leading to further marginalization.\n\n5. **Personal Reflections**: Some individuals, particularly youth, have shared personal reflections on how anti-Asian hate has affected their self-perception and identity. For instance, interviews with Asian American teenagers revealed concerns about acceptance and the pressures they face in balancing cultural identity against societal expectations.\n\n6. **Historical Context**: The discussion around anti-Asian sentiment often reflects on historical discrimination, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Japanese internment camps. This historical framing has resulted in both a sense of continuity of these issues and a call to action to combat ongoing racism.\n\nOverall, the reactions range from a vulnerability in the face of violence to advocacy for change, illustrating a complex emotional landscape surrounding anti-Asian incidents in society.",
