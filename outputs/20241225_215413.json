    "query": "For victims: What kinds of feelings or reactions towards the anti-Asian incidents were described in the mainstream and non-mainstream media for victims?",
    "response": "Victims of anti-Asian incidents have expressed a range of emotions and reactions as described in both mainstream and non-mainstream media. Here are some key feelings and responses captured:\n\n1. **Fear and Anxiety**: Many individuals, including young Asian Americans, report feeling afraid to go out in public due to the rising violence and harassment. This fear is a significant theme emphasized by victims, reflecting their concerns about personal safety and the safety of their families.\n\n2. **Shock and Discomfort**: Initial shock following incidents of violence is common, leading individuals to look for scapegoats. This feeling of discomfort is accompanied by a recognition that such incidents shake the community's sense of security.\n\n3. **Anger and Frustration**: Victims have voiced their anger towards the ongoing anti-Asian racism and the perception that these acts of violence are normalized in society. There is also frustration regarding the media's insufficient coverage of these incidents, which often leaves victims feeling marginalized.\n\n4. **Contemplation and Reflection**: Some survivors reflect on broader societal issues and historical contexts of anti-Asian violence, contemplating what changes are necessary to prevent future incidents. This deep reflection often highlights the destructive impact on victims' lives and their desire for meaningful change.\n\n5. **Alienation and Isolation**: The experiences of discrimination and microaggressions lead many victims to feel alienated from society and unsure of their place within it. The perception of being a \"perpetual foreigner\" contributes to feelings of isolation among Asian Americans.\n\n6. **Call for Action**: Many victims express a desire for collective action and advocacy against anti-Asian hate crimes, calling on government and community leaders to prioritize policies that protect their rights and ensure their safety.\n\nThese feelings and reactions are captured throughout various narratives in both mainstream and non-mainstream media, reflecting the complex emotional landscape navigated by victims of anti-Asian violence.",
