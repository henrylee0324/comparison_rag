    "query": "For victims: What kinds of feelings or reactions towards the anti-Asian incidents were described in the mainstream and non-mainstream media for victims?",
    "response": "Victims of anti-Asian incidents have reported a range of feelings and reactions, as highlighted in both mainstream and non-mainstream media. These include:\n\n1. **Grief and Relief**: Some victims felt profound grief over the incidents of violence, yet also experienced a sense of relief that such events were being recognized and reported more urgently, similar to other forms of racism (score: 0.8799).\n\n2. **Psychological Toll**: The repeated incidents have caused significant psychological stress and anxiety among victims. Many feel a heightened level of stress due to the violence and discrimination they face, which has been exacerbated by a constant barrage of media coverage highlighting the attacks (score: 0.8602).\n\n3. **Fear and Anxiety**: There is pervasive anxiety and fear stemming from the violence, contributing to a collective sense of insecurity in Asian communities. This fear is often tied to social pressures and the stigma associated with being a victim of hate crimes (score: 0.8581).\n\n4. **Wary of Law Enforcement**: Many victims express wariness about engaging with law enforcement due to concerns over immigration status or cultural barriers, as well as a lack of trust in authorities (score: 0.8594).\n\n5. **Mobilization and Sharing Experiences**: A notable reaction is the increasing mobilization among Asian Americans, encouraging individuals to share their experiences and speak out against the violence. This is viewed as a vital step in combating the attacks and raising awareness (score: 0.8565).\n\n6. **Internalized Racism and Alienation**: Victims often grapple with internalized racism and feelings of alienation. This relates to the \"perpetual foreigner\" trope, which makes victims question their identity and belonging in American society (score: 0.8179).\n\nOverall, the feelings and reactions encompass a complex interplay of emotional pain, mobilization for change, and the challenges of navigating societal perceptions and biases.",
