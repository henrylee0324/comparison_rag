    "query": "For organizations (i.e., law enforcement agencies, government officials, and NGO groups): What kinds of feelings or reactions towards the anti-Asian incidents were described in the mainstream and non-mainstream media for them?",
    "response": "The feelings and reactions towards anti-Asian incidents as described in both mainstream and non-mainstream media include a strong sense of urgency and concern over the rising hate crimes against Asian Americans. For instance, many media outlets have spotlighted the issue, emphasizing the importance of civil rights enforcement and violence prevention, reflecting the call from organizations like the Asian American Leaders Table. \n\nThere is a recognition that these incidents cause widespread discomfort and fear within Asian communities, prompting individuals to seek solutions against harmful narratives. The media also critiques how public figures and politicians can influence racial equality, highlighting the dismay in seeing state officials contributing to anti-Asian sentiment.\n\nFurthermore, reports suggest that responses include advocating for greater awareness and visibility of the incidents, as there are claims that media coverage has been inadequate compared to the volume of incidents reported on social media. Finally, there are calls from various organizations for solidarity among different communities of color in addressing this collective struggle against racism and hate crimes.\n\nOverall, there is a mix of alarm, advocacy, and a push for accountability among organizations in response to anti-Asian incidents, reflecting broader concerns about racial equality and social justice.",
