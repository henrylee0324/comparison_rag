    "response": "The types of racism being reported can be categorized into several forms:\n\n1. **Interpersonal/Personally-mediated Racism**: This type involves public expressions of racism between individuals, which often includes slurs, biases, or hateful words and actions.\n\n2. **Institutional Racism**: Occurs through policies and practices within organizations or institutions that endorse discriminatory behavior by creating barriers based on race.\n\n3. **Internalized Racism**: This is when individuals who have experienced racism accept negative societal beliefs and stereotypes about themselves, which can lead to altered self-perceptions.\n\n4. **Cultural Racism**: A set of societal beliefs and customs that create and uphold a system valuing one race over others, impacting how races are viewed within a cultural context.\n\n5. **Structural/Systemic Racism**: A broader system where public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, and other norms collectively perpetuate racial inequity and discrimination.\n\nCurrently, many reports indicate various forms of racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as verbal and physical attacks, denial of services, stigma, and fear of harassment. The data suggests that a significant number of these incidents go unreported, particularly among individuals from Asian communities who may hesitate to come forward due to concerns over immigration status or distrust in reporting authorities.",
